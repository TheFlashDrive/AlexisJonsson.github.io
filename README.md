# FlashDrive hopefully working fork
I'm creating this fork (wip) to hopefully fix some of the issues I've had, mainly being unable to access the dms.
A fix I've found in terms of the server list is installing the HorizontalServerList theme (https://github.com/DiscordStyles/HorizontalServerList), 
it doesn't fix the scrolling between folders and server icons but you can put your servers in a forlder(s) and it fixes the problem for the most part.
I don't exactly know CSS but it seems fairly simple and I hope to get this fixed quickly.
